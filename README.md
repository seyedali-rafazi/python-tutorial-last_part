# What I've Learned from Python

This GitHub repository serves as a record of my learning journey in Python, focusing on two important concepts: classes and modules.

## Classes

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, allowing you to model real-world entities in your code.

Key concepts related to classes include:

- **Attributes**: These are data members that store information about an object's state.
- **Methods**: Methods define the actions or behaviors that objects can perform.
- **Constructors**: Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created.
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and behaviors.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class).

## Modules

Modules in Python are files containing Python code. They help you organize and structure your codebase by allowing you to split your code into separate files.

Key concepts related to modules include:

- **Importing**: You can use the `import` statement to include functionality from other modules into your code.
- **Namespaces**: Modules create separate namespaces, preventing naming conflicts between variables and functions.
- **Standard Library**: Python includes a vast standard library of modules that provide ready-made solutions for various tasks, such as working with files, handling dates and times, and more.

By learning about classes and modules in Python, you gain the ability to create organized, reusable, and efficient code. You can design complex systems by modeling them with classes and leverage the power of existing modules to simplify your projects.

As my learning journey continues, I'll keep updating this repository with more insights and practical applications of classes and modules in Python.
